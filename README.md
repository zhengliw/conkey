Use your controller as a keyboard. Just draw the letters.

No more wusjfwilnsd navigating through a keyboard with your joystick! Time for something intuitive!

Your joystick is your pencil. Draw the letters and watch them appear as input. Morse mode is also supported, allowing you to use morse code to type.

# Work in progress....

Actually, I'm just starting right now and there is no code in here.
